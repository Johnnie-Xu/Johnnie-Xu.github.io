    <h1>About Me?</h1>
    <p>Hey! Glad you stopped by. This was made for my Computing assignment, and I hope you enjoyed it! Apologies for the dump of text though, I can't really make a guide without lots of text. Anyways, you're probably dying to know who I am, right? Well, I'm in Year 9, and I'm Australian/Chinese! Pretty cool, I guess? I also enjoy playing games, a little too much, maybe. I also love music, specifically speedcore and hardcore. There really isn't much else I can say here, other than I'm a bit much at times, and I hope you learnt something. See ya!</p>
